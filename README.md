# the-toolkit

The Tool Kit is a project created to address dark patterns -- a term first coined by Harry Brignull referring to â€œtricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something." We decided to bring light to this issue of online agency with our project through the making of our Tool Kit that consists of a dark patterns Obstacle Course and an ad-replacing browser plug-in.

We decided to dub our game an Obstacle Course because of all the mental gymnastics dark patterns force you to do. The game features Html pages where you have to face dark patterns successfully to get to the next stage. The game makes these dark patterns more obvious to the user so that they can better identify the patterns and become less likely to fall prey to them.

The browser plug-in is an ad-blocker but, instead of the advertisement just disappearing, they are replaced with photos you upload to the site! Rather than being influenced by ads, the user can fill their online space with photos of their choice by uploading photos of family, friends, pets, reminders, encouragement, or anything else! We wanted people to be able to reverse the roles and use ad space to their benefit rather than their detriment.

With the Tool Kit, users can regain their autonomy on the internet and fight back against dark patterns and targeted advertising.
